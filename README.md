This repository includes a few convenience lookup tables for working with census data.
1. A lookup for state name, state abbreviation, and state FIPS code.
2. A county-level look-up containing the county's FIPS code and its 2013 NCHS urban-rural classification: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm
